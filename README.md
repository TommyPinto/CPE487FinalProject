# CPE487FinalProject

This is the GitHub for Group 4's Final Project Code for Digital System Design(CPE487) at Steven's Institute of Technology


This is the final project from group members: Justin Boyd, Thomas Pinto, Matthew Noga, and Samuel Young

The purpose of this project was to explore the new FPGA board given out in class, Terasic's de0 - CV Board

The first few weeks were spent learning the new Verilog code and researching step by step processes to upload basic programs

Once an understanding was built, additional parts of the project were completed. 
By using the GPIO (input/output) pins, the team was able to power an LED light show, and send power to the motors to allow movement. 

All of the working files for the FPGA board are upload on this GitHub

Some basic timers are used in the code as well, and this is an open source project so feel free to build off of what we initially
created as beginners learned about this FPGA Board
